The DNS server that tells you stuff you already know.

# Notdns?

A silly play on words with two meanings: First of all it's *not* a *DNS* 
server, because it lacks virtually every feature a normal DNS server provides. 
Also, it works in emergency (=german "Not") cases, where you don't have the 
right DNS entries configured. Notdns works without configuration, you can't 
even configure it.
